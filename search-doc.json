Ki keybindings are exceptionally coherent due to its mental model.

In Ki, all of these boil down to j and l only!  Ok, how is this possible? It's possible because you have to choose your selection mode first before you move.  For example:  If you want to move to the next word, you enter the Word selection mode first before pressing l (move to next selection).If you want to move to the next line, you enter the Line selection mode first before pressing l  You only have to memorize the movement keybindings once, and then the selection mode keybindings, and you will be able to explore new ways of navigation on your own.  Once you've learned the Ki keybindings, it's tough to look back (at least for me).  Note that the Ki keybindings cannot be simply implemented in Vim/Helix via key- remapping, due to the lack of the concept of Selection Mode, and implementing that requires major architectural changes in the core.

Ki processes your search input in two distinct phases:  Configuration Phase - During this first phase, backslashes only function to escape separators. Character sequences like \\n or \\t are treated as literal characters (a backslash followed by 'n' or 't'), not as special characters. Search Engine Phase - Once the search configuration is constructed, your search query is passed to the appropriate search engine based on the specified mode. It's only in this second phase that special character sequences might gain specific meanings.  For example:  In Regex mode, \\n will be interpreted as a newline characterIn AST Grep mode, $X will be treated as a node captureIn Literal mode, all characters maintain their literal meaning in both phases  This two-phase approach creates a clean separation between configuration syntax and search pattern language, making the system more predictable and easier to use. Once you grasp this separation, constructing complex search patterns becomes significantly more intuitive.
