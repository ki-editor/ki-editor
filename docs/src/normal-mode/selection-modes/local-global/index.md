# Local/Global

Selection modes that are categorized here are those that are applicable both locally (current file) and globally (across the workspace).

There are 3 categories of Local/Global selection modes:

1. [Text Search](./text-search.md)
1. [LSP-based](./lsp-based.md)
1. [Misc](./misc.md)

These selection modes are nested under `f` (Find (Local)) or `g` (Find (Global)).

When using Find (Local) mode, `f` searches forward and `F` searchs backward if
no matching selection is found under cursor.
