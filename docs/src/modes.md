# Modes

In Ki, there are two major modes:

1. Insert mode
2. Normal mode (default)

## Insert Mode

In this mode, the editor behaves like the common editor, where pressing
alphabets on the keyboards inserts those alphabets into the file.

## Normal Mode

In Normal mode, the keys on the keyboards are assigned special meanings.

## To get started

To enter Insert mode, press `i` or `a`.

To enter Normal mode, press `esc`.

## Tips

1. Repurpose the Caplock key on your keyboard to be `esc`.
2. Most of the magic happens in Normal mode, so try not to go to Insert mode unless necessary.
