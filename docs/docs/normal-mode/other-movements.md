# Other Movements

## Keymap

<KeymapFallback filename="Other Movements"/>

The movements categorized here are not affected or bounded by [Selection Modes](./selection-modes/index.md).

## Meaning

### `Scroll ↑`/`Scroll ↓`

Scroll half-page up/down.

### `⇋ Curs`

Swap the primary cursor with the secondary cursor.

By default, the primary cursor sits on the first character of the selection, and the secondary cursor sits on the last character of the selection.

For example, if the current selection is `hello world`, then the cursor sits on `h`, while the anchor sits on `d`.

The secondary cursors serves as a visual aid, making it easier to recognize when the selection range has been modified.

This is especially necessary when using selection modes such as [Fine Syntax Node](./selection-modes/primary.md#syntax-1), where occasionally, the start of a selection remains the same while the end of it changes.

Usefulness:

- When your current selection spans more than a visible screen, and you wish to see what's at the end of the current selection.
  - For example, when you selected a very long function.
- When you wish to start a new selection at the end of the current selection
  - For example, when you select a line and wish to change its last word.

### `⇋ Anchor`

Swap extended selection anchors.

This is only applicable when the selection is extended.

By default, when the selection extension is activated, you can only extend the selection forward,
but with this, you can extend the selection backward too.

This is similar to Vim's Visual Mode `o`.

### `← Select`/`Select →`

Keybindings: `backspace`/`tab`

Go to the previous/next selection. This is similar to Vim's `ctrl+o`/`ctrl+i`, but it onlys work within a file.

This is useful when you messed up the current selection, especially when you are
using [Syntax Node](./selection-modes/primary.md#syntax), and
expanding the current selection to parent node.

Use `← Select` to restore the selection to the previous state.  
Press `Select →` to restore the selection to the current state.

### `← Nav`/`Nav →`

These are useful for navigating back to previous locations after actions such as Go to Definition/References or Global Search.

### `← Curs`/`Curs →`

Cycle primary cursor (selection) backward/forward.

### `← Marked`/`Marked →`

Go to the previous/next marked files.
