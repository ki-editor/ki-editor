# Cut MOL

This is the essentially equivalent to the [Delete MOL](./delete-mol.mdx), except that the current selection will be **copied** to the clipboard before it is deleted.

## Keymap

<KeymapFallback filename="Cut"/>

### Directional Cuts

<TutorialFallback filename="cut"/>

### Cut One

If the layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is cut and collapses to a single-character selection at the cursor position.

<TutorialFallback filename="cut-one" />

### `Replace Cut`

Replace Cut, swaps the current selection with the content in the clipboard.

<TutorialFallback filename="replace-cut"/>
