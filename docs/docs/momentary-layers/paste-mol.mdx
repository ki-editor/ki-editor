| --------- | ------------------------------------- |

## Gap Paste

| Action         | Meaning                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `< Gap Paste`  | Paste **BEFORE** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<`**/**`>`** selection(s)   |
| `Gap Paste >`  | Paste **AFTER** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<`**/**`>`** selection(s)    |
| `<< Gap Paste` | Paste **BEFORE** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<<`**/**`>>`** selection(s) |
| `Gap Paste >>` | Paste **AFTER** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<<`**/**`>>`** selection(s)  |

Gap Paste works by analyzing the gap between the current selection and the
`<`/`>`/`<<`/`>>` selection, then insert the gap before/after the pasted text.

For example, consider the following Javascript code:

```js
hello(x, y);
```

Assuming the current selection mode is Syntax Node, and the current selection is `y`, and the
copied text is `z`, performing a `Paste >>` results in the following:

```js
hello(x, y, z);
```

Because the gap between the current selection (`y`) and the the `<<`/`>>` selection is `, `, where the `<<` selection is `x`.

## Replace

If this layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is replaced with the clipboard content.

### Replace with copied text

Replace current selection with previous/next copied text in the clipboard history.

This is similar to [Yanking Earlier Kills](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Earlier-Kills.html) in Emacs.

This is useful when you want to retrieve earlier copies.
