# Paste MOL

## Keymap

<KeymapFallback filename="paste"/>

## Paste

Paste the clipboard content before or after the current selection, without automatic gaps insertion.

<TutorialFallback filename="paste"/>

## Paste with gaps

Paste with gaps works by analyzing the gap between the current selection and the
previous/next selection, then insert the gap before/after the pasted text.

For example, consider the following Javascript code:

```js
hello(x, y);
```

Assuming the current selection mode is Syntax Node, and the current selection is `y`, and the
copied text is `z`, performing a `p` results in the following:

```js
hello(x, y, z);
```

## Replace

If this layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is replaced with the clipboard content.

<TutorialFallback filename="replace"/>
