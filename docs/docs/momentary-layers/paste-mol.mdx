# Paste MOL

When this layer is activated, the following movements are overridden with the following behaviors:

| Movement      | Meaning            |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Left/Right    | Paste with gaps    |
| Previous/Next | Paste without gaps |

Notes:

- Paste `<movement>` does not replace the current selection.
- The pasted text will be selected.

## Paste with gaps

Paste with gaps works by analyzing the gap between the current selection and the
previous/next selection, then insert the gap before/after the pasted text.

For example, consider the following Javascript code:

```js
hello(x, y);
```

Assuming the current selection mode is Syntax Node, and the current selection is `y`, and the
copied text is `z`, performing a `p` results in the following:

```js
hello(x, y, z);
```

<TutorialFallback filename="paste"/>

If the layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is replaced with the clipboard content.
