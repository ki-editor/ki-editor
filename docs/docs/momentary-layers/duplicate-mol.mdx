# Duplicate MoL

This very similar to the Paste MoL, except that it doesn't modify the system clipboard, as it treats the current selection(s)
as the copied text(s).

## Vertical Duplication

| Action  | Meaning                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Dup ^` | Duplicate current selection **ABOVE** the current selection |

## Gapped Duplication

| Action       | Meaning                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `< Gap Dup`  | Duplicate current selection **BEFORE** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<`**/**`>`** selection(s)   |
| `Gap Dup >`  | Duplicate current selection **AFTER** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<`**/**`>`** selection(s)    |
| `<< Gap Dup` | Duplicate current selection **BEFORE** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<<`**/**`>>`** selection(s) |
| `Gap Dup >>` | Duplicate current selection **AFTER** the current selection with gaps between the current selection and the **`<<`**/**`>>`** selection(s)  |

Gapped Duplication works by analyzing the gap between the current selection and the
`<`/`>`/`<<`/`>>` selection, then insert the gap before/after the pasted text.
