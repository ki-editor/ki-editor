## Workflow Overview

This workflow is designed to streamline your editing process by allowing quick
access to your primary files.

During an editing session, you often work on
primary files while occasionally referring to other less important files.
Using Buffer MoL, you can quickly jump back to your main files, enhancing your
productivity and focus.

By utilizing file marking, you can efficiently navigate your editing
environment and maintain your workflow's momentum.
