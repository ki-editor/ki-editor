# Buffer MoL

## Keymap

<KeymapFallback filename="Buffer"/>

In this MoL, every core movement means:

> change focus to \<movement\> buffer.

Buffers can be either marked or un-marked: each marked file gets its own tab
on the tab bar, however only one the very rightmost end of the tabs on the tab bar
show the open buffers.

When using coarse movements like `>>` and `<<` you can only visit navigate to marked files.
Opened but non-marked files can be navigated-to through fine-movements like `>` and `<`.
Noteably, when doing `<<` on the left-most marked-file, the focus lands "warps" or cycles to
the righmost file.

Besides the core movements based actions, a few other common actions are also sheltered in the Buffer MoL
these are: closing the current buffer, and unmarking all files except the current one.

## Examples

<TutorialFallback filename="mark-file"/>

<TutorialFallback filename="open-file"/>

## Workflow Overview

This workflow is designed to streamline your editing process by allowing quick
access to your primary files.

During an editing session, you often work on
primary files while occasionally referring to other less important files.
Using Buffer MoL, you can quickly jump back to your main files, enhancing your
productivity and focus.

By utilizing file marking, you can efficiently navigate your editing
environment and maintain your workflow's momentum.
