# Delete MOL

When this layer is activated, movement keys are overridden with the following behavior:

> Deletes both the current selection and the whitespace/gap leading to the `<movement>` selection, then moves to select the `<movement>` selection.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete"/>
<TutorialFallback filename="delete-finer-movement"/>

If the layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is deleted and collapses to a single-character selection at the cursor position.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete-one" />

For more details on the design rationale behind Delete's behavior, see [Evolution of Delete](/ki-editor/blog/evoluation-of-delete).
