# Delete MOL

## Keymap

<KeymapFallback filename="Delete"/>

### Directional Deletes

Directional Deletes deletes the current selection, along with the gap between the current selection and the `<movement>` selection,
then selects the `<movement>` selection.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete"/>

<TutorialFallback filename="delete-finer-movement"/>

### Delete One

If the layer is deactivated immediately without pressing any movement key, the current selection is deleted and collapses to a single-character selection at the cursor position.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete-one" />

For more details on the design rationale behind Delete's behavior, see [Evolution of Delete](/blog/evoluation-of-delete).
