# `Delete`

In this submode, every core movement means:

> delete current \<selection mode\> selection until the \<movement\> selection.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete"/>

<TutorialFallback filename="delete-finer-movement"/>

Sometimes, one might want to only delete the current selection without deleting gaps.

<TutorialFallback filename="delete-0-gap" />
